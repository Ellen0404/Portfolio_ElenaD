                       <p>I’m happy you’re reading this section- my digital introducing.
                            I’m Russian Jewish who got married in Italy and now living in the United States)
                            I have  lived in 3 different countries, dived into 3 totally different cultures, 
                            and tried to get along with 3 different languages.  Not easy,  but always interesting and challenging!
                            I got my Bachelor degree in Finance and worked a lot for financial institutions, 
                            opened my own business and tutored Hebrew.
                            However,  I always knew there is something else for me, 
                            something more artistic and creative,  more fascinating.
                            When I got my first camera I had no doubt – this is it!
                            Freeze the moment before it fades, stop that emotion you have 
                            here and now  – that’s my goal – to give you these energies, so 
                            you can relive them forever!
                            It’s not just the passion for photography that moves me,
                             it’s actually the people whom I photograph, 
                             their connections between each other , their feelings. 
                            How suddenly she smiles when she looks at him ,
                             how calm he becomes when he hugs her..It’s always been 
                             amazing to me  how our eyes, lips, and body change when we look at the person we love!
                            I want to show it to you, it’s so beautiful..
                         </p>
