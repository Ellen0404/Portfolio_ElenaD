                  <p>I’m happy you’re reading this section - my digital introducing. I’m Russian Jewish who got married
                     in Italy and now living in the United States) I have lived in 3 different countries, dived into 3
                     totally different cultures, and tried to get along with 3 different languages. Not easy, but always
                     interesting and challenging! I got my Bachelor degree in Finance and worked a lot for financial
                     institutions, opened my own business and tutored Hebrew.<br> However, I always knew there is something
                     else for me, something more artistic and creative, more fascinating.  When I got my first camera it
                     was the love from the first sigh. I love the photography and that vibe being behind the camera. 
                     Freeze the moment before it fades, capture that emotion you have here and now – that’s my behind
                     the camera mission – to give you these energies, so you can relive them forever!<br>Nevertheless, the
                     analytical side of me was a bit bored, so I kept looking . I was creating a 
                     <a style="color:#4d7992" href="https://ellendphoto.com/">website for my
                      photography business</a> and the process fascinated  and excite me so much that I decided to go deeper.
                     I found this whole world of creativity and logical connections, I found that logic could be very
                     creative and beautiful , that was the perfect combination of that I was looking for. So here I am,
                     exploring this amazing world of coding , tying my best and integrating this knowledge into my
                     updated life! Please enjoy browsing every single page of my coding word and feel free to contact me
                     with your questions, ideas and interesting projects !
